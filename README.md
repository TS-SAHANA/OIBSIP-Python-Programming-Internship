# Oasis-Infobyte-Python-Programming-Internship

Welcome to my Oasis Infobyte Python Programming Internship repository! üêç This repository features a collection of Python projects developed during the internship.

## Basic Weather App üå¶Ô∏è

The Basic Weather App is a simple yet effective weather information retrieval tool. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to provide real-time weather data based on user input. The application supports both city-based and automatic location-based weather retrieval.

**Features:**
- Fetches weather data using OpenWeatherMap API.
- User-friendly GUI with input for city and temperature unit.
- Auto-detection of the user's location based on IP address.
- Displays temperature, description, humidity, wind speed, and country.
- Historical data visualization for weight, height, and BMI.

**How to Run:**
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Install required libraries: `requests`, `tkinter`, `PIL`, `geocoder`.
3. Run the `WeatherApp.py` file.

## BMI Calculator üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The BMI Calculator is a health and fitness tool that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for weight and height. It categorizes the BMI into different health classes such as Underweight, Normal Weight, Overweight, and Obese.

**Features:**
- Calculates BMI and categorizes into health classes.
- Saves historical BMI data to a file.
- Visualizes historical data with Matplotlib.

**How to Run:**
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Install required libraries: `tkinter`, `matplotlib`.
3. Run the `BMI_Calculator.py` file.

## Random Password Generator üîê

The Random Password Generator is a utility to create strong and secure passwords with customizable options. It allows users to select the length of the password and choose from different character sets.

**Features:**
- Generates random passwords with specified length.
- Customizable character sets include uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols.
- Copies generated passwords to the clipboard.

**How to Run:**
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Install required libraries: `tkinter`, `PIL`, `pyperclip`.
3. Run the `PasswordGenerator.py` file.
